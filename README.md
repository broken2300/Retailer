# Retailer
2017 FALL database Project

Enviroment : J2EE Spring SpringMVC Mybatis
Database : MySql

The enterprise is a retailer, such as a department store, discount store, supermarket, con-
venience store, etc.; each of you will choose a specific retailer (either use a real one as
your model or a made-up one). To keep the project within bounds, weâ€™ll ignore issues of
employees, corporate finance, etc., and focus on the retail sales activities.
